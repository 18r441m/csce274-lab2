# Python Fundamentals Lab

Welcome to the Python Fundamentals Lab! This lab is designed to give you hands-on experience with the essential features of Python programming. The lab consists of six exercises, each focused on a particular aspect of the Python language.

## Exercises
- Exercise 1: Variables - [variables.py](./exercises/variables.py)
- Exercise 2: Basic Operations - [basic_operations.py](./exercises/basic_operations.py)
- Exercise 3: Lists and Dictionaries [lists_and_dicts.py](./exercises/lists_and_dicts.py)
- Exercise 4: Control Flow - [control_flow.py](./exercises/control_flow.py)
- Exercise 5: Functions - [functions.py](./exercises/functions.py)
- Exercise 6: Libraries and Modules - [libraries.py](./exercises/libraries.py)

## How to Use This Lab
